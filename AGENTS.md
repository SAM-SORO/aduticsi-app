# ADUTI Platform Context and Terminology Rules

## Platform Context
You are working on the ADUTI (Association des DUT et DTS en Informatique de l'INP-HB) application platform.
**CRITICAL CONTEXT:** This platform is **NOT** a tool for people to join the association or become members.
The association already exists, and its members are already known (students and alumni of INP-HB).
The purpose of this platform is simply to allow **existing members** to activate their access, register their profile on the platform, and connect with each other.

## Terminology Enforcement
When writing UI text, documentation, comments, or suggesting features, you MUST adhere to the following terminology rules to avoid misleading users:

### DO NOT USE (Misleading term):
- "Rejoindre l'association" (Join the association)
- "S'inscrire à l'association" (Register for the association)
- "Devenez membre" (Become a member)
- "Rejoignez-nous" (Join us) - when referring to the association itself.

### USE INSTEAD (Correct term):
- "S'enregistrer" (Register on the platform)
- "Activer son accès" (Activate access)
- "Créer son compte" (Create account)
- "Accéder à l'espace membre" (Access the member space)
- "Se connecter avec ses pairs" (Connect with peers)

**Rationale:** The registration page (`/auth/register`) is strictly for activating an online profile for someone who is *already* considered a member of ADUTI by right of their INP-HB status. No text should imply that filling out the form grants them membership to the association itself.
